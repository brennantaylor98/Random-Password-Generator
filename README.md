#NAME: PASSWORD GENERATOR MODULE 3 PROJECT


#INTRODUCTION:
Hello, my name is Brennan. I have created this javascript based password generator. I have used many tools and incorporated many elements and functions into this project.

#DESCRIPTION:
With this project you have access to a variety of different passwords, randomized every time and containing between 8-127 different unique characters. It selects from uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters to create a password that is unique every single time. If you try to create a password that is below 8 characters, above 127 characters, or does not contain any of the traits listed above then you will not receive a password but instead a null will report back.

#BADGES:
This Project does not contain any badges nor does it contain image sources.

#INSTALLATION:
This program is very simple to run. Navigating to the specified URL you will be met with an alert that allows you to select what type of characters you would like on your password. After all the promps have been successfully filled out. Pressing the "Generate Password" button will provide you with your unique password.

#SUPPORT:
If this does not operate like the above installation guide says, you may have entered an invalid entry. Remember your password can only be between 8-127 characters long, and must have at LEAST either an uppercase, lowercase, special character, or a number. If it still gives you an error you can email me at paxtbiz@gmail.com for a timely response on why this issue is still occurring for you.

#ROADMAP: 
In the future I plan to increase the amount of passwords you can generate at one time, and potentially give you an option to use multiple passwords at once. 

#CONTRIBUTORS:
Being that this is still in early access I will not be accepting any contributions on this project. However if you have suggestions on how this Password Generator can be better operated or streamlined do not hesitate to reach out and let me know at paxtbiz@gmail.com.

#AUTHORS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
This was all done by me, however a great resource I used that helped me along this journey was MDN and W3schools. Without their extremely helpful website I would not have been able to overcome the issues that this site first gave me and been able to correct it.

#THANKS:
Thank you for viewing this project of mine. I hope to have more projects like this and many others coming soon for the entirety of this bootcamp. I look forward to presenting them to everyone and showing how hard I work to be able to create something that anyone can use to ease their daily life routines.
